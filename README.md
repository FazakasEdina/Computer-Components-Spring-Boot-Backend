# Computer Components Spring Boot Backend
I build this simple project for my enterprise applications course. I had asked to create a backend server about a hardware components web-shop.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

JDK Java Development Kit<br/>
Gradle 7.1 <br/>
Database: MySQL <br />
<br />

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `edu.bbte.idde.feim1911.spring.Main` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can run from terminal:

```shell
gradle bootRun
```

I used the Postman platform to test the application.
